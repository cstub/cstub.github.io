### About me

As a Machine Learning Engineer and AI Engineer, my expertise lies at the intersection of AI innovation and practical application.
I develop and deploy machine learning and deep learning models, specializing in constructing robust machine learning systems from concept to large-scale production environments. My expertise includes tailoring algorithms to business needs, optimizing performance, and ensuring scalable integration into existing technologies.
I am deeply interested in machine learning and deep learning methodologies, consistently striving to keep up-to-date with the latest developments in the field.

I am highly proficient in designing and implementing distributed architectures and have built a wide variety of reactive systems. From 2015 to 2018 I led the development of a reactive microservice framework and helped creating a distributed messaging infrastructure for event-driven application communication.

I am an advocate of clean concise code and practices promoting resilient software systems, employing these methods in my daily work.

An essential part of my professional life is the pursuit of new skills, experimenting with innovative technologies and discovering new approaches to solving problems with software.

If you have a project I can help with, please get in touch.
