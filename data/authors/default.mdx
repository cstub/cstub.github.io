## Hello, I'm Christoph

I am a freelance AI engineer with a strong background in machine learning, MLOps and distributed systems. 
I have over 5 years of experience building AI systems and more than a decade designing distributed systems.

I work through every phase of the AI lifecycle‚Äîfrom early prototypes to large-scale production systems. 
I combine the latest AI research with practical engineering, working closely with my clients to ensure our projects go well beyond research 
demos and deliver value in production.

Outside of client projects, I‚Äôm also engaged in [open-source work](/open-source) and exploratory research, currently focusing on *cognitive architectures* and *agent-based systems*.

I‚Äôve helped companies like MerlinOne and Canto build and deploy [large-scale AI search platforms](/portfolio#enterprise-scale-visual-search) that process and index millions of images and videos 
in real time, combining distributed inference (PyTorch, Triton, Kubernetes) with distributed vector databases (Milvus) for scalable, 
low-latency retrieval. These platforms are used by *thousands of customers* including [The Associated Press](https://newsroom.ap.org/) - enabling them to use advanced visual image and video search simply 
by describing visual content. 
I also [scaled computer vision models](/portfolio#ai-powered-visual-intelligence-suite) on AWS to process over *100M+ assets* and conducted model fine-tuning to optimize performance on domain-specific data.

At cyan Security Group, I designed a comprehensive [MLOps platform](/portfolio#enterprise-mlops-platform-from-data-to-deployment) (Databricks, MLFlow, AWS) that automated data pipelines, 
model deployment, and real-time monitoring ‚Äîallowing rapid iteration from prototype to production. I also trained and integrated [computer vision models](/portfolio#deep-learning-content-filter-for-security-applications) 
into the cyan security suite, including child protection and content filtering products, to detect malicious or sensitive web content.

As a distributed systems engineer, I have developed a [reactive microservices framework](/portfolio#reactive-microservices-framework-for-high-performance-systems) and built a 
[distributed messaging infrastructure](/portfolio#event-driven-messaging-for-media-services) to enable high-throughput, event-driven communication‚Äîensuring scalability and fault tolerance across mission-critical client services.
