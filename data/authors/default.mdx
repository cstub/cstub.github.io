## About Me

I am a freelance ML & AI engineer with a strong background in agentic systems, MLOps, distributed systems, and cloud-native architectures.

I build reliable AI applications and support their entire lifecycle - from early prototypes to large-scale production systems. My work involves both hands-on engineering and mentoring teams.

Active [open-source](/open-source) contributor and co-founder of [gradion.ai](https://gradion.ai).

## Professional Journey

I’ve helped companies like MerlinOne and Canto build and deploy [large-scale AI search platforms](/portfolio#enterprise-scale-visual-search) that process and index millions of images and videos 
in real time, combining distributed inference (PyTorch, Triton, Kubernetes) with distributed vector databases (Milvus) for scalable, 
low-latency retrieval. These platforms are used by *thousands of customers* including [The Associated Press](https://newsroom.ap.org/) - enabling them to use advanced visual image and video search simply 
by describing visual content. 
I also [scaled computer vision models](/portfolio#ai-powered-visual-intelligence-suite) on AWS to process over *100M+ assets* and conducted model fine-tuning to optimize search performance on domain-specific data.

At cyan Security Group, I designed a comprehensive [MLOps platform](/portfolio#enterprise-mlops-platform-from-data-to-deployment) (Databricks, MLFlow, AWS) that automated data pipelines, 
model deployment, and real-time monitoring —allowing rapid iteration from prototype to production. I also trained and integrated [computer vision models](/portfolio#deep-learning-content-filter-for-security-applications) 
into the cyan security suite, including child protection and content filtering products, to detect malicious or sensitive web content.

As a distributed systems engineer, I have developed a [reactive microservices framework](/portfolio#reactive-microservices-framework-for-high-performance-systems) and built a 
[distributed messaging infrastructure](/portfolio#event-driven-messaging-for-media-services) to enable high-throughput, event-driven communication—ensuring scalability and fault tolerance across mission-critical client services.
